### A sucky airy thingy for soldering fumes. Sucks harder than your ex!  
![images/overview.png]  

## Q&A
### But... ...why?
I really wanted to do something for [this event](https://highway.hackclub.com/) and didn't have ideas. Some other guy wanted to do this but changed his mind.  
I got many more ideas since then and I wish I have started working on them, especially with the new Highway rules.  
I am writing this way with the assumption that some time traveler might eventually stumble upon this.
### Features?
You plug in a barrel plug, turn knob to change sucking power and see RPM + stats on display.  
Oh, and almost forgot to mention, there's a slot for a carbon filter.  
...that's it. That's the whole goddamn thing.
### How do I wire it?

### Where firmware?
Not yet.
### License?

I... ...don't have much of anything else to add, really.
